# Resume-Parser
NLP

One excellent example of unstructured data is a resume. Every resume has a different formatting style, distinct data blocks, and multiple data formatting options. This complicates the programmatic process of reading resumes. Recruiters take their time reviewing resumes and choosing candidates who are a good fit for open positions. Every day, thousands of resumes are submitted for various job positions at tech giants like Google and Facebook, and recruiters are unable to review every single one of them. For those who are similar to them, Resume Parsers are a terrific resource. Choosing the ideal resume from the pile of resumes you receive is made simple by resume parsers.
